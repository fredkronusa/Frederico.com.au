					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Frederico Kronemberger da Cruz, I have 10+ years' of
						commercial experience in front-end
						web development using JavaScript frameworks such as React (redux | mobx),
						Angular (RxJS), Ember,
						Backbone and jQuery, Typescript with Typestyle or Style-JSX, HTML5, SASS
						(BEM | OOCSS), GULP/GRUNT &
						WEBPACK task runners. I have a good understanding of responsive web
						design, progressive enhancement,
						graceful degradation concepts, cross-browser compatibility issues and
						accessibility techniques using
						HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap. I've worked across a multitude of
						high-profile clients always focusing
						in improve reusability of components, accessibility standards and quality
						testing coverage. </p>
					<p>I am currently contracting at <a href="https://coles.com.au"
							target="_blank">Coles</a> developing
						their new online shopping app. From day one, focusing on improving
						pipeline, code re-usability,
						responsiveness of the application and performance.</p>
					<p>Before that I was contracting at <a href="https://auspost.com.au"
							target="_blank">Australia Post</a>
						developing the new Western Union over the counter app. A very complex
						system build with dynamic
						fields and validations based on on-time currency rates and country to
						country regulations. In my
						spare time, I am also worked on extracting components from current
						projects into a self-documented
						component library to stop the current re-work on simple atoms and
						molecules. The library is
						dependency-free and has had the best adoption of any previously written
						library by other teams.</p>
					<p>Previous to that, I contracted at <a
							href="https://www.energyaustralia.com.au" target="_blank">Energy
							Australia</a>, working on the development of a reusable component
						library and a Greenfield
						governance project to enable customers to set up a customizable payment
						plan for their accounts. The
						project uses angular 7 with RxJS and a shared JavaScript service library
						which is used by multiple
						projects including the mobile applications and the web responsive website
						to minimize code
						repetition across platforms when retrieving customer's information.</p>
					<p>Previous to that, I contracted at <a href="http://www.nab.com.au/"
							target="_blank">NAB</a>, focusing
						on improving performance, code quality and framework upgrades. I was
						invited to re-join the team as
						a senior contractor to create a momentum to move forward with technology.
						I was working with a small
						team of gun developers to align our project with other NAB projects with
						the ultimate goal of
						creating a unified library that can be reused by both business to
						business banking and internet
						banking.</p>
					<p>Previous to that, I contracted at <a
							href="https://www.sportsbet.com.au"
							target="_blank">SportsBet</a>, working on their Greenfield project which
						will replace their
						mobile, IOS and web platform using the latest technology including
						React/Redux, Typescript and
						Typestyle. My focus was to help to structure the backbones of the
						application. I was in charge of
						local storage and liveServ solutions which involves custom middleware’s
						and reducers to transform
						received data into a normalised model.</p>
					<p>Previous to that, I was consulting at <a href="http://www.nab.com.au/"
							target="_blank">NAB</a>
						(National Australia Bank), working on the NAB CONNECT project, a business
						to business banking
						solution that is evolving to allow receivables and payables to be
						processed and available instantly
						between banks. As a senior front end engineer, I was responsible for
						coding Angular reusable
						components and directives, accessible content (WCAG) and responsive pages
						(and a bit of JAVA when
						needed). During my time there, I received 2 awards; one for setting code
						standards by integrating
						lint into the projects and fixing over 15000 errors and another for
						integrating Git Hooks and
						assuring no more broken builds due to developers checking in code with
						broken tests.</p>
					<p>Prior to that, I contracted for <a href="http://www.optus.com.au"
							target="_blank">Optus Singtel</a>,
						enhancing and developing multiple parts of their website including the <a
							href="https://www.optus.com.au/customercentre/activateprepaid"
							target="_blank">Prepaid Mobile
							Activation</a> one page app, using cutting edge technologies such as
						JQuery, Backbone JS,
						Handlebars, Meteor Blaze, Require JS, Underscore, Freemarker, Jasmine
						Unit Test, Grunt, Jenkins,
						Karma and GIT.</p>
					<p>In 2011 I finished my Bachelors of Information Technology (System
						Programming) with a GPA of 6.2
						(High Distinction). I have been awarded as the student with the highest
						grade/top achiever for the
						following courses:
						<ul style="list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 16px;">
							<li>JAVA Programming </li>
							<li>System Development </li>
							<li>Information Security </li>
							<li>Database Use and Design</li>
							<li>Information System Project Management </li>
							<li>Applied Distributed Systems. </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Before University, I have concluded a Certificate IV in web design
						(TAFE NSW) and a Diploma in Web
						Development using .NET technologies (TAFE NSW).</p>
					<p>My strengths include determination, rapid learning ability and eager
						interest for the IT industry.
						Looking beyond technology, I also have strong skills in working with
						people, which has enabled me to
						be a great team player. In this capacity, I have gained experience in how
						to listen and understand
						team leader&rsquo;s needs, respond to them and find solutions for any
						problems that arise.</p>
